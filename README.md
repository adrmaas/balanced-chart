# balanced-chart
A simple generic helm chart that can be used with multiple projects.

In sailing the sails can be balanced so that there is no steering load on the tiller. The goal is to get the boat to track straight with minimal helm input.

This chart aims to act as a basic generic helm chart that will deploy a service with a minimal set of input using common best practices.
